    "### **What is Git?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and maintain version history. It allows you to manage and track the evolution of files in your project efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is GitHub?**\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git. It provides a central location to host and share Git repositories. GitHub adds collaboration features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools, making it ideal for teamwork.\n",

    "| **Definition**       | Git is a distributed version control system to track changes in code. | GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting and managing Git repositories. |\n",
    "| **Purpose**          | Manages source code history, branches, and version control locally. | Facilitates collaboration, repository hosting, and sharing projects online. |\n",
    "| **Type**             | Command-line tool (software).                                    | Web-based platform/service.                                      |\n",
    "| **Offline Access**   | Git works completely offline.                                    | Requires internet for accessing repositories or performing operations. |\n",
    "| **Hosting**          | Git does not host repositories. You use it locally on your machine. | GitHub hosts repositories on the cloud for easier sharing and access. |\n",
    "| **Collaboration**    | Collaboration requires manually sharing files or setting up a remote server. | Provides built-in collaboration features like pull requests, issues, and code reviews. |\n",
    "| **User Interface**   | Primarily command-line interface (CLI).                          | Provides a graphical user interface (web app) along with CLI.    |\n",
    "| **Authentication**   | No authentication required for local repositories.               | Requires authentication (e.g., username and password or SSH keys). |\n",
    "| **Integration**      | Can be integrated with any server or platform for remote repositories. | Integrates with Git, and also supports CI/CD tools, project boards, and more. |\n",
    "| **Additional Features** | Focused on version control and managing branches.               | Adds features like issue tracking, wikis, team collaboration, and project management. |\n",
    "| **Examples**         | You use Git commands to initialize a repository or manage branches. | You use GitHub to host the repository for remote access and collaboration. |\n",
