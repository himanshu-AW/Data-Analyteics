    "### **What is a Time Series in Pandas (Simplified)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **time series** is data that is recorded or observed over time at specific intervals (e.g., daily stock prices, hourly weather reports, or yearly sales). In Pandas, time-series data is handled using dates or times as the index for organizing and working with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If you have sales data recorded every day, you can organize it by the date for easy analysis.\n",
    "- Pandas provides tools to work with these dates and times efficiently, like filtering data by a specific time range, calculating trends, or grouping data by months or years.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Does Pandas Help with Time Series?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexing by Time**:\n",
    "   - You can use dates or times as the index to locate or organize data.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import pandas as pd\n",
    "     dates = pd.date_range('2024-01-01', periods=5, freq='D')\n",
    "     data = [100, 200, 150, 300, 250]\n",
    "     df = pd.DataFrame({'Sales': data}, index=dates)\n",
    "     print(df)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Output:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "                 Sales\n",
    "     2024-01-01    100\n",
    "     2024-01-02    200\n",
    "     2024-01-03    150\n",
    "     2024-01-04    300\n",
    "     2024-01-05    250\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filter by Time**:\n",
    "   - You can filter data for specific dates or date ranges.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(df['2024-01-02':'2024-01-04'])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Output:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "                 Sales\n",
    "     2024-01-02    200\n",
    "     2024-01-03    150\n",
    "     2024-01-04    300\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time-Based Grouping**:\n",
    "   - Summarize data by months, years, or weeks (e.g., total sales for each month).\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   monthly_sales = df.resample('M').sum()\n",
    "   print(monthly_sales)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Trends**:\n",
    "   - Add rolling averages or cumulative sums to see trends in your data.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df['Rolling_Avg'] = df['Sales'].rolling(window=2).mean()\n",
    "   print(df)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When Should You Use a Time Series?**\n",
    "- When analyzing data over time, such as:\n",
    "  - **Sales trends**\n",
    "  - **Stock prices**\n",
    "  - **Website traffic**\n",
    "  - **Temperature changes**\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Pandas, you can simplify working with time-based data and perform tasks like filtering, summarizing, and visualizing trends quickly."

    "### **What is `Timedelta` in Pandas?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **`Timedelta`** in Pandas represents a difference between two dates or times. It is useful for handling **time durations** or **time offsets** in time-series data. Pandas provides the `Timedelta` object and related functionality to perform time arithmetic, such as adding, subtracting, or calculating the difference between timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features of `Timedelta`**\n",
    "1. **Creation of Timedeltas**\n",
    "   - You can create a `Timedelta` using:\n",
    "     - Days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds.\n",
    "     - Strings or integers with time units.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Using strings\n",
    "     pd.Timedelta(\"2 days 3 hours 45 minutes\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Using keyword arguments\n",
    "     pd.Timedelta(days=2, hours=3, minutes=45)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Timedelta Arithmetic**\n",
    "   - Add or subtract timedeltas to/from timestamps.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     timestamp = pd.Timestamp(\"2024-01-01 10:00:00\")\n",
    "     delta = pd.Timedelta(days=1, hours=5)\n",
    "     print(timestamp + delta)  # 2024-01-02 15:00:00\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Difference Between Dates**\n",
    "   - Calculate the difference between two timestamps, returning a `Timedelta`.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     start = pd.Timestamp(\"2024-01-01\")\n",
    "     end = pd.Timestamp(\"2024-01-05\")\n",
    "     print(end - start)  # 4 days 00:00:00\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Timedelta in DataFrames**\n",
    "   - Use timedeltas in Pandas DataFrames for operations like calculating durations or shifting.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     df = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "         \"Start\": pd.to_datetime([\"2024-01-01\", \"2024-01-02\"]),\n",
    "         \"End\": pd.to_datetime([\"2024-01-05\", \"2024-01-06\"])\n",
    "     })\n",
    "     df[\"Duration\"] = df[\"End\"] - df[\"Start\"]\n",
    "     print(df)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Operations on Time Series**\n",
    "   - Shift or lag time-series data using timedeltas.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     dates = pd.date_range(\"2024-01-01\", periods=5, freq=\"D\")\n",
    "     df = pd.DataFrame({\"Value\": [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]}, index=dates)\n",
    "     df.index = df.index + pd.Timedelta(days=1)  # Shift all timestamps by 1 day\n",
    "     print(df)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Pandas Functions with Timedelta**\n",
    "1. **`pd.Timedelta()`**: Create a `Timedelta` object.\n",
    "2. **`pd.to_timedelta()`**: Convert an array-like or scalar to a `Timedelta`.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   pd.to_timedelta([\"1 days\", \"2 days 12:30:00\"])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **`TimedeltaIndex`**: Use timedeltas as an index for a DataFrame.\n",
    "4. **Attributes**: Access parts of a timedelta.\n",
    "   - `days`, `seconds`, `microseconds`, etc.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   delta = pd.Timedelta(\"2 days 3 hours\")\n",
    "   print(delta.days)         # 2\n",
    "   print(delta.seconds)      # 10800 (3 hours in seconds)\n",

    "### **Examples of Use Cases**\n",

    "1. **Calculate Processing Times**\n",
    "   - Measure the duration between start and end times for tasks or events.\n",

    "   print(shifted)\n",
    "   ```\n",
